# Resume Project

This project aims to develop my skills as a developer by forcing me to use technologies that I don't usually practice. At the same time, this project also serves to create a curriculum page to present to anyone who might be interested.
The following technologies will be used:

 - **HTML**
 - **CSS**
 - **JavaScript**
 - **PHP**
 - **Python**
 - **SQL**
 - **Docker**
 
Implemented so far:
 - [x] **FrontEnd**
 - [ ] **BackEnd**
 - [ ] **Database**
 - [x] **Docker**

## FrontEnd
##### This section will be implemented with HTML, CSS and  JavaScript.

The **FrontEnd** will consist in a simple web page to display some pertinent information about the Resume. The webpage will be based on the design present on this [page](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1892?siteId=cd7cf75a-1837-4c9d-bdf3-19d9204309e9&metaSiteId=3d1060d5-8d62-4059-9829-d6c7a768ad26&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv&tpClick=view_button).
It uses **JavaScript** to create the carousel made in **HTML** (it intentionally avoids using Bootstrap in order to provide a bigger challenge).

## BackEnd
##### This section will be implemented with Python and PHP.

The **BackEnd** consist of **PHP** code to send an email with the data filled on the **FrontEnd** form and **Python** code to communicate with the **Database** and provide the data for the **FrontEnd**. The intent is to provide a dynamic project where the data is easy to update.

## Database
##### This section will be implemented with **SQL** 

As a personal preference the **Database** will be implemented using **MySQL**. The diagram can be consulted in the corresponding folder.

## Docker
##### This section will be implemented with **Docker** (duh!)

This project will be converted to Docker in order to be easy to deploy it without having to worry about the dependencies and environment. To use the project change the '.env copy' file to '.env' and make the necessary changes to your usecase.
